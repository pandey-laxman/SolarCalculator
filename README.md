# SolarCalculator

In order to assist Photographers with planning of their photoshoots, we'll build an Application that provides Rising & Setting time of Sun and the Moon. Rising & Setting time will be referred to as Phasetime hereafter.

Phasetime can be calculated using this https://github.com/erndev/EDSunriseSet. Implementation requires a date and location ( longitude and lattitude ) as an input. User can provide the desired location using a Search Bar, move the Red pin or the Application will use current GPS location as default. 
For quick access, Application will be able to show past persisted locations by the user.
